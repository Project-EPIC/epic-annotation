**OK Fire data lacked Tweet IDs, making it difficult to release in accordance with Twitter and IRB concerns. We are working on a solution.

The data provided includes only annotations, and not original tweets, as these are not available through the university. For access to the tweets, please see the <a href="https://github.com/Project-EPIC/epic-annotation/blob/master/Epic%20Tweet%20Documentation.pdf">Epic Tweet Documentation</a>. We've released SRL data for Hurricane Gustav and the Red River floods with the original text, as we were unable to reconstruct the SRL information using only Tweet IDs.
