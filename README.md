**The new data from the paper <b>Developing and Evaluating Annotation Procedures for Twitter Data During Hurricane Events</b> from the LAW-MXE-CxG workshop (2018) will be available soon, under annotations/CHIME-2018. We are still working on creating publishable versions of the dataset and the guidelines. Thank you for your patience.**

Annotation data released under Project Epic. We're still working on the collected data; here's what is and what will be available:

<table>
  <tr><td>Dataset</td><td># of Tweets</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Named Entity Annotation for 10 different events</td><td>18081</tr>
  <tr><td><a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-6201">CHIME</a> Classification for Hurricane Sandy</td><td>7490</td></tr>
  <tr><td>**Situational Awareness, Formality, Person, and Subjectivity from  <a href="http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM11/paper/download/2834/3282">Verma et al (ICWSM 2011)</a> for 3 events</td><td>1500</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Semantic role labeling for a variety of events</td><td/></tr>
  <tr><td>*Part-of-speech tagging for a variety of events</td><td/></tr>
</table>
*Will be available soon<br>
**OK Fire data lacked Tweet IDs, making it difficult to release in accordance with Twitter and IRB concerns. We are working on a solution.

The data provided includes only annotations, and not original tweets, as these are not available through the university. For access to the tweets, please see the <a href="https://github.com/Project-EPIC/epic-annotation/blob/master/Epic%20Tweet%20Documentation.pdf">Epic Tweet Documentation</a>.
We have released SRL data for two events, Hurricane Gustav and the Red River floods, with original tweet texts, as we are unable to reconstruct the SRL data using only the Tweet IDs.
