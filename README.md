  <tr><td>**Situational Awareness, Formality, Person, and Subjectivity from  <a href="http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM11/paper/download/2834/3282">Verma et al (ICWSM 2011)</a> for 3 events</td><td>1500</td></tr>
  <tr><td>*Part-of-speech tagging for a variety of events</td><td/></tr>
  <tr><td>*Semantic role labeling for a variety of events</td><td/></tr>

**OK Fire data lacked Tweet IDs, making it difficult to release in accordance with Twitter and IRB concerns. We are working on a solution.

The data provided includes only annotations, and not original tweets, as these are not available through the university. For access to the tweets, please see the <a href="https://github.com/Project-EPIC/epic-annotation/blob/master/Epic%20Tweet%20Documentation.pdf">Epic Tweet Documentation</a>.
