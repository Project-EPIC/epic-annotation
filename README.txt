Data annotated for the EPIC Project at the University of Colorado. 

The data is currently split into two folders : Public, and With_Text. For
Public data, we aren't allowed to release tweet text. We are allowed to release
Tweet IDs, and allow other people to gather the text through the Twitter's
API and affiliates. For CU use we are allowed to use the With_Text data,
which includes the text of the tweets.
