# <a href="https://github.com/Project-EPIC/epic-annotation/tree/master/annotations/POS/">Part of Speech Annotation</a>
This annotation is simple part of speech tags for collections of tweets surrounding multiple events. This annotation was done by using an automatic POS tagger, and the output was then hand corrected. The datasets we include and number of tweets for each are as follows:

<ul>
  <li> Dallas Tornado (2012) : 850</li>
  <li> Haiti Earthquake : 487</li>
  <li> Hurricane Gustav : 1,000</li>
  <li> Highland Park Fire : 700</li>
  <li> New Zealand Earthquake : 14,800</li>
  <li> Oklahmoa Fires : 449</li>
  <li> Red River Floods (2009 and 2010): 14,340</li>
</ul>

Each event has a file, with each line containing a word and the corrected part of speech. Tweets are separated by blank lines.
